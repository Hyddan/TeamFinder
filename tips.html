							<b>GENERALS</b>
							<br/>

							<br/>
							<br/>
							2: Number of players: For an official game, five players and a goalie for each team 
							are required on the court but games can be played with as few as three and a 
							goalie. The maximum roster size is 20 players per team. The goalie may be 
							substituted for an additional player if desired. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							3: Game length: An official game is comprised of three 20-minute periods. Game 
							length may vary depending on the league or tournament but the last three minutes 
							of every game must be effective (stop) time. Teams change sides and benches 
							each intermission. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							4: Substitutions: May occur on the fly at any time but players must change within the 
							designated substitution zone, which is 10 meters long and includes the player 
							benches. Each team's zone starts 5 m from the centre line. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							5: Creases: There are two creases: 
							1) The goal crease (4 x 5 meters) where the goalie may use his/her hands. 
							2) The goalkeeper area (1 x 2.5 meters) which field players cannot enter 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b>GAME PLAY</b>
							<br/>
							1: Stick interference: Players cannot lift, slash, hold or otherwise impede an 
							opposing player's stick. A minor infraction results in a free hit, a major infraction 
							(dangerous play, infraction in a scoring position or repeated infractions) results in a 
							two-minute penalty. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							2: High Stick: Players cannot make contact with the ball using their stick above 
							average knee level. Players cannot raise their sticks above waist level at any time, 
							including on the backswing or follow-through of a shot. Minor infraction (free hit), 
							major infraction/dangerous play (2 min penalty). 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							3: Hands: Players cannot use their hands to play or touch the ball with the exception 
							of the goalie within the goal crease. (Infraction results in a 2 min penalty) 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							4: Feet: Players cannot use their feet to pass to another player but players may kick 
							the ball once onto their own stick. (Free hit) 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							5: Head: Players cannot play the ball with their head. (2 min penalty) 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							6: Jumping: Players cannot jump to play the ball, one foot must be on the ground 
							when touching the ball. (2 min penalty) 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							7: Playing from the ground: Players cannot go down on two knees to make plays or 
							block shots; only goalies may play from their knees. (2 min penalty) 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							8: Playing your stick between another player's legs: is not allowed. (free hit) 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							9: Illegal distance: Defensive players (or their sticks) cannot be within 3 meters of the 
							ball on a free hit. (2 min penalty) 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							10: Crease violation: Defensive players (or their sticks) cannot be inside the goalie 
							crease (the inner crease). Defensive player playing the ball in the crease (penalty 
							shot), defensive players not touching the ball or offensive players in the crease (free 
							hit) 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							11: Body contact: Only incidental shoulder contact (like soccer) is allowed. Players 
							cannot hold opposing players or their jerseys or interfere with their movement. 
							Minor infraction (free hit), major infraction (dangerous play, infraction in a scoring 
							position, or repeated infractions) (2 min penalty) 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b>SPECIAL SITUATIONS</b>
							<br/>
							12: Face-offs: Face-offs are used to start the game at the beginning of each period, to 
							re-start after each goal or in any other situation that does not result in a free hit (i.e. 
							damaged ball). Face-offs to start periods or after goals take place at centre, all 
							other face-offs are taken at designated spots on the floor (corners and spots on the 
							centre line at each end). 
							For a face-off, stick blade must be on the ground and perpendicular to center line 
							(goal line for face-offs in the corner), feet equidistant to center line (goal line) and 
							the ball must be in the middle of the two players' sticks. Players cannot reverse their 
							grip or hold the stick below the face-off line (a line marker on the stick). Play starts 
							with a whistle blow. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							13: Free hits: Free hits occur in the foul situations cited above as well as when the ball 
							goes out of play. 
							The ball is played as a direct free shot similar to a soccer free kick and defensive 
							players and their sticks must be at least three meters away. All free hits are direct 
							and must be played with a solid hit (not a wrist shot, scooping or sweeping motion). 
							Free hits can be played as soon as the ball is settled and only free hits after a 
							penalty has been require a whistle blow before play can begin. If the offensive team 
							is judged to be delaying the game (typically three seconds once they stop the ball), 
							possession is reversed and the free hit goes to the defensive team. 
							Similar to soccer a referee may opt to call an advantage if they deem that it is 
							advantageous to the fouled team to keep play going. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							14: Penalty shots: Penalty shots are awarded when a defender plays the ball in the 
							goalie crease or when an infraction is committed on a clear scoring chance 
							(typically a breakaway). Anyone on the floor at the time the penalty shot is awarded 
							is allowed to take the shot. The ball is placed at centre and the ball must always be 
							moving forward (cannot go backwards) or the penalty shot is over.

							There are 17 basic rules of soccer called "Laws of Game". FIFA (Federation Internationale of Football Association) is in charge of enforcing their application worldwide. When these rules are modified by any organization, league, country, or competition, they become "Local rules of soccer".
							When a player enters the pitch, what basic rules of soccer must he know first? Here is a quick look of these rules through easy to remember questions.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<b>RULES</b>
							<br/>
							1: Field of play. You have two standards soccer field of play. The big size is 120 x 90 meters (130 x 90 yards). The small size is 90 x 45 meters (100 x 50 yards). Local rules enforce small sizes per age level.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							2: The ball. It should be spherical made of leather or suitable material. The standard ball size is 5. This ball size is used for international official games. The limited age to use ball size 5 is age 13. Ball size 4 is used for players between ages 9 and 12. Ball size 3 is used for players between ages 6 and 8.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							3: Number of players. Each team should have eleven (11) players on field. A goalie is one of them. Know that only three substitutions are permitted during an official soccer game. This number changes when it comes to indoor soccer.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							4: Players' equipment. The two teams wear different colors during a soccer game. Players on the field wear jersey with numbers, shorts, socks, shin guards, and footwear. The goalkeeper wears a different uniform from his teammates with gloves.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							5: A referee. He is the enforcer of the basic rules of soccer during the game. He makes sure all players respect the rules. If a player breaks any basic rule of soccer during the game, the referee uses either a verbal warning, yellow or red cards, according the nature of the offense.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							6: Assistant referees. There are two assistant referees for a soccer game. They advise the referee about an offense committed out of his view. The final decision belongs to the referee, not to the assistants for any offense occurs during the game.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							7: Duration of the match. A standard soccer match lasts 90 minutes. There are two equal periods of 45 minutes. A break period of 15 minutes is required between the two periods. The duration of the match can change with local rules.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							8: The start and restart of the play. A kick off is a way of starting and restarting a soccer game. It happens at the start of the first and second periods of the match. A kick off is used after a goal was scored by a team. It also happens during extra period time. A throw-in is a method of restarting play. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							9: The ball in and out of play. The ball is out of the field of play if it crosses the goal line or touch line on the ground or by the air. The ball is also out of play when the referee stops the play. Otherwise, the ball is in play all the time. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							10: The method of scoring. A team scores a goal when the whole circumference of the ball crosses the goal line without any offense of the rules of soccer. The ball should cross the goalposts and under the crossbar. A goal can be scored even when the ball crosses the goal line through the ground or the air. The team that scores a greater number of goals wins the match. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							11: Offside position. A player is offside position when he is closer to his opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent. He is not offside position if he is in the same line with his opponents. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							12: Fouls and misconduct. They are reckless, careless, and excessive use of force against an opponent. They result to a direct free kick when a player kicks, jumps, trips, charges, strikes, pushes, tackles, holds, spits, or handles the ball deliberately against an opponent. A direct free kick is taken from where the offense occurred.
							They result to an indirect free kick when a goalkeeper or a player commits any offense within is own penalty area. Therefore, a penalty kick is awarded to opponent team. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							13: Free kick. There are two types of free kick. Direct free kick happens according the offense and can be kicked direct to into the opponent goal. Indirect free kick is a two movement's shout. They can't be kick directly to the opponent goal. The ball must be played by a second player before going to the opponent goal.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							14: Penalty kick. It is awarded when the defense commits a foul inside its own penalty area and while the ball is play. All offenses resulting to a direct free kick lead to a penalty kick. During the penalty kick, all players should be out of the penalty box.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							15: Thrown-in. It is a method of restarting the play. A goal can't be score directly from it. It happens when a player last touches the ball before it goes out of the field of play. The opposition team gets the thrown-in.
							To throw-in the ball, a player should keep his feet on the ground and out of touch line, use both hands, and throw the ball from behind over his head. This is the only time players in the field can use their hands to touch the ball.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							16: Goal kick. It is a method of restarting a soccer match when the offensive team sends the ball out of the goal line or end line. A goal may be scored directly from a goal kick, but only to the opponent team. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							17: Corner kick. It is awarded to the offensive team when the defensive team was last touches the ball before it crosses the goal line or end line. It is kicked at the nearest corner.
							Soccer requires smart thinking. Basic rules of soccer are a big part of that thinking. It is crucial for a young player to master these basic rules of soccer. A player who knows the basic rules of soccer can avoid mistakes during a soccer game.
